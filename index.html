    <p class="para1">Scooby-Doo is an American animated franchise comprising many animated television series produced from 1969 to the present, 
        as well as its derivative media. Writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears created the original series Scooby-Doo, 
        Where Are You! for Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1969. 
        This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured teenagers Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville "Shaggy" Rogers
         and their talking brown Great Dane named Scooby-Doo who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series
          of antics and mis-steps.</p>
